I'm an experienced software C/C++ developer with 17+ years under my belt; I worked in all aspects of SDLC.  The applications I developed were in real time, batch processing systems and API programs for major retail clients.  These programs focused on financial, employee tracking and audit reporting.  Also did customer support and trouble shooting.  Most recognized for my analytical, research and problem solving skills.
I am currently updating my professional skills in web development.
I have worked on a few simple programs, so far, that I am committing to GitHub.
The first project was very intersting, I am excited and really enjoying developing for front end web.
This project is done in OO code using HTML5, CSS3, JSON files, jQuery and Ajax.
I have the headers and footers on each DOM being loaded from the JSON files.
Also one of the DOM pages containing a book table has the book information also being loaded from a JSON files.  And on that book table page there are selection buttons to sort on all columns on the table.
Other cute features are on the Video page and on the Form page where I keep a count of the time left on the video and the count of characters left on the form Comments box.
